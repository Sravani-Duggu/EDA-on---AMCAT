Project Overview
This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the AMCAT dataset, which provides insights into employability trends for fresh graduates. The analysis aims to uncover key trends related to salary, specialization, gender representation, and the impact of educational backgrounds.

Dataset Description
The AMCAT dataset contains various attributes related to graduate employability, including:

Candidate demographics (e.g., gender, education)
Job roles and salary ranges
Skills and specializations
Performance metrics
Tools and Technologies
The following tools and libraries were utilized for this analysis:

Python
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For numerical operations
Matplotlib: For data visualization
Seaborn: For enhanced visualizations
SciPy: For statistical analysis
Key Steps in the Analysis
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Data Visualization: Creating visual representations to identify trends and patterns.
Correlation Analysis: Analyzing relationships between variables to derive insights.
Trend Identification: Highlighting key insights related to salary, specialization, and representation.
Key Findings
Salary Trends: Job roles such as Programming Analyst and Software Engineer align with industry standards.
Specialization Matters: Graduates in Computer Science and IT fields are earning higher salaries.
Gender Representation: There is an uneven distribution of male and female graduates across certain roles, indicating potential gender disparities.
Skills Pay Off: A strong positive correlation exists between technical skills and higher salaries.
Educational Background: Graduates from Tier 1 institutions generally earn more, emphasizing the importance of college reputation.
